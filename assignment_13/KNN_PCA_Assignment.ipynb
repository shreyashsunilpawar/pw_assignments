        "### What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and how does it work in both classification and regression problems?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised, instance-based learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity between data points. It does not build an explicit model during training; instead, it stores the entire training dataset and performs computation only at prediction time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Working Principle:**\n",
        "1. Choose the value of *k* (number of neighbors).\n",
        "2. Compute the distance between the test point and all training points (commonly Euclidean distance).\n",
        "3. Select the *k* closest neighbors.\n",
        "4. Aggregate their outputs to make a prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Classification:**\n",
        "- The predicted class is the majority class among the *k* neighbors.\n",
        "- Example: If 3 out of 5 nearest neighbors belong to class A, the test sample is classified as class A.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Regression:**\n",
        "- The predicted value is the average (or weighted average) of the target values of the *k* neighbors.\n",
        "- Example: Predicting house prices using the mean price of nearby houses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:** Simple, non-parametric, effective for small datasets.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Curse of Dimensionality refers to problems that arise when working with high-dimensional data. As the number of features increases, the volume of the feature space grows exponentially, causing data points to become sparse.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving as much important information (variance) as possible. PCA achieves this by transforming the original correlated features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.\n",

        "Feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features from the original dataset without transforming them. Common techniques include:\n",
        "- Filter methods (correlation, chi-square).\n",
        "- Wrapper methods (recursive feature elimination).\n",
        "- Embedded methods (Lasso, tree-based importance).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences:**\n",
        "- PCA creates new features, while feature selection chooses existing ones.\n",
        "- PCA focuses on maximizing variance, whereas feature selection focuses on feature relevance.\n",

        "1) Dimensionality Reduction - Eigenvalues allow us to select only those components that explain most of the variance, reducing dimensionality while preserving information.\n",
        "2) Noise Reduction- Components with very small eigenvalues often represent noise and can be discarded.\n",
        "3) Explained Variance -Eigenvalues are used to compute the explained variance ratio, which helps in selecting components (e.g., 95% variance rule).\n",
