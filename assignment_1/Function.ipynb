        "1)What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "     -\n",
        "    Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    **Reasons why Python is popular:**\n",
        "     Easy to Learn and Read – Its syntax is simple and close to natural language, so beginners can understand it quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Versatile – Can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Large Standard Library – Comes with many built-in modules and functions that save time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Cross-Platform – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more without major code changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Strong Community Support – A large community provides tutorials, documentation, and third-party packages.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Integration Capabilities – Easily integrates with other languages like C, C++, and Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -An interpreter is a program that reads and executes code line by line instead of converting the entire program into machine code at once.\n",
        "    In Python, the interpreter processes each line of code, translates it into machine-readable instructions, and immediately runs it. This allows quick testing and debugging but can be slower than compiled languages.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "3)What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python that have a special meaning and purpose in the language. These words are part of Python’s syntax and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "    Example:if = 5   #  Invalid, because \"if\" is a keyword\n",
        "    Examples of Python Keywords: and, or, not, if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue,def, import, return, True, False, None\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved words with special meaning in the language.\n",
        "    If we try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will give a SyntaxError.\n",
        "    Example:for = \"this is loop\"   #  Invalid, because \"for\" is a keyword\n",
        "\n",
        "5)What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "    Mutable objects → Can be modified without creating a new object.\n",
        "    Immutable objects → Cannot be modified changing them creates a new object.\n",
        "    example: my_str = \"Hello\"\n",
        "    my_str[0]='n' #gives error because string is immutable\n",
        "    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    my_list[0] = 10 #allowed because list is mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "6)Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Lists are mutable\n",
        "    Lists are designed to store collections of items where the data may need to change.\n",
        "    They allow adding, removing, or modifying elements without creating a new object.\n",
        "    -Tuples are immutable\n",
        "    Tuples are designed to store fixed collections of items.\n",
        "    Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements — any change creates a new tuple.\n",
        "    -Reason for the difference:\n",
        "    Lists prioritize flexibility → they are meant for dynamic data.\n",
        "    Tuples prioritize stability and performance → they are faster and can be used as dictionary keys because they don’t change.\n",
        "\n",
        "7)What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - \"==\" Equality operator compares values of object e.g a=5 ,b=5 a == b output is True\n",
        "    - “is” Identity operator\tcompares memory locations where this values are stored\n",
        "    e.g a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    print(a is b)  #False (different memory locations)  \n",
        "\n",
        "8)What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Logical operators are special symbols in Python that are used to combine conditional statements and return a Boolean value (True/False) based on the conditions.\n",
        "    -Types of logical operator 1)and 2)or 3)not\n",
        "    1)and :- Returns True if both conditions are true\n",
        "    e.g :- (5 > 2) and (4 > 1)\n",
        "    output :- True\n",
        "    2)or :-Returns True if at least one condition is true\n",
        "    e.g :-(5 > 2) or (4 < 1)\n",
        "    output:-True\n",
        "    3)not :-Reverses the result (True → False, False → True)\n",
        "    e.g :-not(5 > 2)\n",
        "    output:-False\n",
        "\n",
        "9)What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another in Python.\n",
        "    Types of Type Casting:\n",
        "    1)Implicit Type Casting -Done automatically by Python. Example:x = 5  \n",
        "    python automatically convert 5 into int\n",
        "    2)Explicit Type Casting -Done manually using built-in functions.\n",
        "    example:\n",
        "    num_str = \"100\"\n",
        "    num_int = int(num_str) #Here string \"100\" convert into integer value 100\n",
        "\n",
        "10)What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Implicit type casting in Python happens automatically when the interpreter converts one data type into another to avoid data loss. For example, when you add an integer and a float (5 + 2.5), Python automatically converts the integer into a float and gives the result as 7.5. In this process, the programmer does not need to do anything, and no special function.\n",
        "    -Explicit type casting, on the other hand, is when the programmer manually converts one data type into another using built-in functions such as int(), float(), str() and so on. For example, if we have a string \"100\" and want to use it in a calculation, we can convert it into an integer by writing int(\"100\"), which will allow you to perform arithmetic operations on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "11)What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False. They help control the flow of a program so that certain actions are performed only when specific criteria are met.\n",
        "\n",
        "    For example, using statements like if, elif, and else, Python can check conditions and choose which code to run:\n",
        "    code:-\n",
        "    age = 18\n",
        "    if age >= 18:\n",
        "        print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print(\"You are not eligible to vote.\")\n",
        "12)How does the elif statement work\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The elif statement is used when we want to check multiple conditions in a program.\n",
        "    It comes after an if statement and before an optional else statement.\n",
        "    Python evaluates conditions from top to bottom as soon as it finds a condition that is True, it executes that block of code and skips the rest.\n",
        "    e.g code\n",
        "    name='shreyash'\n",
        "    if 'om' == name:\n",
        "        print('match option 1')\n",
        "    elif 'shreyash' == name:\n",
        "        print('match found ption 2')\n",
        "    elif 'athrav' == name:\n",
        "        print('match found ption 3')\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        print('match not found')       \n",
        "\n",
        "13)What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -The for loop in Python is used when we know in advance how many times we want to execute a block of code. It is typically used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, tuple, string, or range of numbers.\n",
        "    For example:\n",
        "    for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(i)\n",
        "    -while loop\n",
        "    This loop will run exactly five times, printing numbers from 0 to 4.\n",
        "    The while loop, on the other hand, is used when we do not know in advance how many times the loop should run. Instead, it keeps executing the block of code as long as a given condition remains True. For example:\n",
        "    count = 0\n",
        "    while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(count)\n",
        "    count += 1\n",
        "    This loop will continue running until the condition count < 5 becomes False\n",
        "\n",
        "14)Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Suppose we are creating a program that asks a user to enter a password until they get it right. Since we don’t know how many attempts the user will take, a while loop is ideal:\n",
        "    password = \"python123\"\n",
        "    user_input = \"\"\n",
        "    while user_input != password:\n",
        "        user_input = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "    print(\"Access granted!\")\n",
        "    Here the loop will keep running until the correct password is entered. which makes it more appropriate than a for loop that runs a fixed number of times.\n",
